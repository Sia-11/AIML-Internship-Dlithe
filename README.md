# AIML-Internship-Dlithe:
Anemia & Thrombocytopenia Prediction

Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based solution for the prediction of two critical blood disorders: Anemia and Thrombocytopenia. Anemia is characterized by a lower-than-normal level of red blood cells or hemoglobin in the blood, while Thrombocytopenia is a condition with a low platelet count. Early and accurate detection of these disorders is crucial for timely medical intervention.

#Key Features
Machine Learning Models: The project employs several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), to predict the presence of Anemia and Thrombocytopenia.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset used for training and testing the models is preprocessed to remove unnecessary features and ensure data quality.

User-Friendly Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface for individuals to input their medical data, such as gender, hemoglobin levels, MCH, MHCH, MCV, and platelet count. The models then predict whether the user is likely to have Anemia or Thrombocytopenia.

Model Comparison: The accuracy of each machine learning model is compared to determine the best-fitting model for prediction.

#Getting Started
